The alited is a "project oriented" editor,
not a general purpose one.

It provides nearly all of the necessary
to develop Tcl/Tk projects.

And alited project has been developed
by its own version 0.2 since 24 April 2021.
---
The projects seen by alited are stored in
~/.config or a directory chosen at the very
first start of alited. Or passed as the first
argument to alited.

The name of config directory is shown in the
title of "Preferences" dialogue. üó©
---
The "Projects" tab contains options that
can be set for new projects if the appropriate
checkbox is set ON.

If the checkbox is set OFF, options for new
projects are taken from a current project.
---
"Projects" dialogue is available in "Setup"
menu and in the tool bar.

Let's open "Projects" dialogue.
---
The "default" project refers to alited's
installation directory, just for a start.

Plus, the alited's code may be used
as a source of code snippets viewed at
their work immediately in the alited!

Especially so, if you use "apave" package
the alited is based on. üó©
---
Let's create a new project.

We must fill the appropriate data fields
- most importantly a project directory.
---
After filling the new project's fields
we press "Add" button to create it.
---
Another method to create a project is
"Create a project by template" button.

This method is based on the template of
directory / file tree, in Templates tab.
---
There may be up to 16 templates, all their
names being collected in the combobox.

Let's create a template. After its use,
it is saved in the combobox's values.

To view the result, we can hit "Project
directory" button.
---
Let's open a project.

Just selecting it in the list,
then hitting "Select" button.
---
To open existing file(s) of our project
we can switch to the project file tree.

Then, with double-clicking a file, we open it.

The open files are highlighted in the file tree.

After closing a file, it is unhighlighted.
---
A newly open file is placed to
the beginning of the tab bar.

üó∞ This is true even when a selected tab
isn't visible in the tab bar.
---
The alited provides basic facilities
for arranging a project's directory:
  * create / delete / move files

These facilities are very basic, e.g.
directories aren't moved.

The file managers of such type
help with little things sometimes.
---
Let's try "Create File/Directory"
actions on the file tree.
---
To move files in the file tree,
we use nearly the same actions
as in the unit tree.

The alited is rather consistent. üòâ
---
When projects are switched,
the alited saves and restores:

  * a list of open files
  * cursor positions in the files
  * a currently open file
  * a list of favorites
  * a list of favorites' lists
---
So, when we switch to another project,
alited closes all files of the old project
and open all files of the new project.

If we want some files of the old project
to remain open, we select their tabs with
Ctrl+click and switch to a new project. üó©
---
Another way to open files of a project
inside the current one is a file list
of "Projects / Options" dialogue.

The files to be open are selected with
simple clicking them. After that, we
open them from the list's context menu.

Or we open a file with a double-click.
---
This "Projects / Options" dialogue can
be nicely used for a sort of clearance.

It's when a lot of files need to be
selectively closed in the project.
---
The currently edited files are listed in
the file list available through:

  * right-clicking the tab bar of files
  * choosing "Tools/File List" menu item
  * pressing F9 key (it's customizable)
---
Note that the file list has two separators,
just to see:

  * files of currently visible tabs of the bar
  * left "invisible" files
  * right "invisible" files
---
The file list can be sorted. For this,
set the appropriate switch.

And voila: F9 key opens the sorted list.
It's good to access files open in alited's
session.
---
The detailed info of files can be switched
on/off by "Setup/Tip File Info" menu item.

The file info is available in:

  * the tab bar
  * the file list
  * the file tree
---
The "Projects" dialogue contains "Notes" and
"Reminder" fields to support a development.

The "Notes" are very good for projects that
are developed unsteadily, from time to time,
allowing to keep a list of ideas.

The "Reminder" is very good for all of projects,
allowing to keep deadlines of TODOs.

üó∞ Both "Notes" and "Reminder" are good at
maintaining projects.
---
The reminders are bound to dates (deadlines).

When a reminder became out-dated, there will
be blinkings and whistlings!
# TRANSPOPS_red
---
If a TODO needs to be postponed, it can be
moved on a day / week with "move" buttons.
---
Last few words about another interesting option.

Its default value is set in "Preferences"
but in "Project" settings it can be reset. üó©
---
The "Unit lines per 1 red bar" option means that
N lines of a unit are considered normal, while
each N additional lines of a unit would add
a red bar to its icon at the unit tree, up to 7th bar.

When the icon becomes fully red, this is like sending
"too long unit" message, i.e. the unit probably needs
some reforming.
---
Let's set this option to 5 which would mean
a procedure/method of 40 or more lines will be
fully red marked.
---
This thing is too long, so it's "too red".
Even not too rosy.
