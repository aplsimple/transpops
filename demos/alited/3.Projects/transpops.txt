The alited is a "project oriented" editor, not a general purpose one.

The alited provides nearly all the necessary to develop Tcl/Tk projects
without ever quitting it till a machine's shutdown.
---
The projects seen by alited are stored in
~/.config directory chosen at the very first start of alited.

You can copy it and pass the copy's name
as an argument to the alited.

This allows keeping various types of projects
at one machine: public/private, for work/fun...

... configuring them accordingly.
---
The projects are listed in "Setup / Projects" menu item.
Also, there is "Projects" icon of the tool bar.
---
The default project refers to alited's
installation directory, just for a start.
---
Let's create a new project.

We must fill the appropriate data fields
- most importantly a project directory.
---
After filling the new project's fields
we press "Add" button to create it.
---
Let's open a project.

Just selecting it in the list,
then hitting "Select" button.
---
To open existing file(s) of our project
we can switch to the project file tree.

Then, with double-clicking a file, we open it.

To open all Tcl files of a directory
we use the tree's popup menu. Let's do it.
---
The open files are highlighted in the file tree.

When a file is closed it's unhighlighted.
---
A newly open file is placed to
the beginning of the tab bar.

This is true even when a  selected tab
isn't visible in the tab bar.
---
The alited provides basic facilities
for arranging a project's directory:
  - create a file / directory
  - delete a file / directory
  - move file(s) to other directory

These facilities are very basic, for example
directories aren't moved in alited's file tree.

Still, the file tree can help with little actions.
---
Let's try "Create File/Directory"
actions on the file tree.
---
To move files, we can use:
  - "Move Up/Down" buttons
  - the tree's popup menu
  - drag-and-drop
---
For moving files, we can select
a whole group of them with Ctrl+click.

Then, with "Move Up/Down" buttons
we move them to an upper/lower directory.

There is no facility to drag-and-drop a group.
---
Though, if a selected group needs
to be moved to some far location
"Drop selected..." menu item might be helpful.

The group files may be selected
without any order / sequence.
---
If a currently edited file does NOT belong
to the current project directory, we can move this file to it.

For this, use "Move File" buttons.
---
When projects are switched,
the alited saves and restores:

  - a list of open files
  - cursor positions in the files
  - a currently open file
  - a list of favorites
  - a list of favorites' lists
---
So, when we switch to another project,
alited closes all files of the old project
and open all files of the new project.

If we want some files of the old project
to remain open in the new project,
we select them in the tab bar by Ctrl+click,
then we switch to the new project.
---
There is an option in "Preferences"
allowing to save an edited file's copies.

The number of saved copies is 1 through 99.

Sometimes this option can be VERY HELPFUL,
specifically when SCM is helpless.
---
Last few words about another interesting option.

Its default value is set in "Preferences"
but in "Project" settings it can be reset.
---
The "Unit lines per 1 red bar" option means that
each N lines of a unit would add a red bar to its icon
at the unit tree, up to 7th bar.

When the icon becomes fully red, this is like
sending "a bit too long unit" message, i.e.
the unit probably needs a sort of reforming.

There are 8 grades of redness: 0, 1*N, 2*N, 3*N ... 7*N.

So, if N=20, then 141 lines would mean "a too long unit".

Just look at the unit tree to find those horrible reds,
candidates for reforming.
---
Let's set this option to 10
which would mean a procedure/method
of >= 71 lines will be fully red marked.
---
This thing is too long, so it's "fully red".
Even not rosy.
