There are a few of theming options for alited.

All are located in Setup menu:
  - Setup / Preferences
  - Setup / Tint

Let's try Preferences.
---
Two options of General tab work together:
  - Ttk theme
  - Color scheme

It's only for default, clam, classic and alt themes
that the color scheme can be chosen freely.

For other themes, a color scheme should be chosen
according to their dark/light background.
---
The standard Ttk themes are:
  - default
  - clam
  - classic
  - alt
  - awlight
  - awdark

These themes are most recommended for their stability.
---
The standard Ttk themes allow tinting
their colors with "Tint" option.

The negative values mean "darker",
the positive values mean "lighter".
---
Let's try "clam" theme with a color scheme.

Also, let's set a tint.
