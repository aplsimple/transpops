Updating this demo 20 Sep 2022, we see the warning
about an old TODO not closed.

The "closing" means that we just delete them.

OK. There are a few of theming options for alited.

All are located in Setup menu:

  * Setup / Preferences
  * Setup / Tint

Let's try Preferences.
---
Two options of General tab work together:

  * Ttk theme
  * Color scheme

It's only for default, clam, classic and alt themes
that the color scheme can be chosen freely.

For other themes, a color scheme should be chosen
according to their dark/light background.
---
The standard Ttk themes are:

  * default
  * clam
  * classic
  * alt
  * awlight
  * awdark

These themes are most recommended for their stability.
---
The color schemes can be tinted with "Tint" option,
their colors being darker or lighter.

The negative values mean "darker", the positive values
mean "lighter", 0 means "original tint at start".

The range of tints is rather wide: -50 through 50,
though the reasonable one is often -25 through 25.
---
Let's try "clam" theme with a color scheme.

Also, let's set a tint.
