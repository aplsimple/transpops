The "Setup / Tint" allows to change a tint
of a current color scheme.

It's per a session only.

When all of sudden you get a feeling that
too much of light / darkness is around,
this option might help.

Let's return to Preferences again.

For azure, forest, sun-valley themes
there are their appropriate color schemes:
  - AzureLight / AzureDark
  - ForestLight / ForestDark
  - SunValleyLight / SunValleyDark

These are most fit to each other,
still for any light / dark theme there is
a nice appropriate light / dark color scheme.

Let's try "azure-dark" theme.
It needs a dark color scheme.

"AzureDark" is probably a best choice.

But we might try another dark theme, say, "MildDark".
The difference will be in:
  - color of context menu
  - color of gutter
  - color of line's highlight
