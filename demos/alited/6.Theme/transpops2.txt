The "Setup / Tint" allows you to tint
a current color scheme.

It's per a session only.

When all of sudden you get a feeling that
too much of light / darkness is around,
this option might help.

All of submenus of alited have "tear-off"
feature which is quite convenient for
multiple choices.

For example, we might switch some tips off,
keeping Projects' and Last Visited's ones
(still, TODOs are shown all the same).

Let's return to Preferences again.

For aw*, azure, forest, sun-valley themes
there are their appropriate color schemes:
  * AwLight / AwDark
  * AzureLight / AzureDark
  * ForestLight / ForestDark
  * SunValleyLight / SunValleyDark

Still, for any light / dark theme there is
a nice appropriate light / dark color scheme.

For example, nice dark theme / CS pairs are:
  * awdark / MildDark1
  * azure-dark / Quiverly
  * forest-dark / Dusk
  * sun-valley-dark / AwDark (favorite!)

Plus, "Tint" option and 4 defaults of Tcl
syntax... Uff, so much good combinations!
---
Let's try "azure" theme.
It needs an appropriate color scheme.

"Azure" is probably a best choice.

But we might try another scheme.
The difference will be in:
  * color of context menu
  * color of gutter
  * color of line's highlight
