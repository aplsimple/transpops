The colors of Tcl syntax can be set as well.

These settings are located in
Setup / Preferences / Editor.
---
Let's change some colors.
---
There is a small restriction:
    If a color scheme is changed from light to dark
    and vice versa, the syntax colors become disabled,
    as they are specific for a light / dark background.

In such cases, alited should be restarted for
the syntax colors to be accessible.
---
Also, we might try "awdark" theme by Brad Lanam
with a dark color scheme, for example "Oscuro3".
---
Well, let's save settings and restart alited.
