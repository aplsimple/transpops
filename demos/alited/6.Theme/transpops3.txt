The colors of Tcl syntax can be set as well.

These settings are located in
Setup / Preferences / Editor.

Let's change some colors.

At that we view and test them in "Code snippet"
field.

If we want some specific commands be highlighted
(in the same color as Tk), we enter them in "Your
commands" field.
---
Due to msgcat, alited is easily localized, with
locale .msg files being in data/msgs directory.

Let's try this feature.

As for flags: alited uses the Stars and Stripes
instead of the Union Jack just because of the
origin of computers and words like 'color'.
---
Also, we might try "aw" theme by Brad Lanam
with the "Aw" appropriate color scheme.
---
At last, we'll change a color scheme of

  * e_menu
  * Tkcon
