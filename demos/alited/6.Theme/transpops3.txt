The colors of Tcl syntax can be set as well.

These settings are located in
Setup / Preferences / Editor.
---
Let's change some colors.
---
There is a small restriction:
    If a color scheme is changed from light to dark
    and vice versa, the syntax colors become disabled,
    as they are specific for a light / dark background.

In such cases, alited should be restarted for
the syntax colors to be accessible.
---
Due to msgcat, alited is easily localized, with
locale .msg files being in data/msgs directory.

Let's try this feature.

(As for flags: alited uses the Stars and Stripes
instead of the Union Jack just because of the
origin of computers and words like 'color'.)
---
Also, we might try "awdark" theme by Brad Lanam
with a dark color scheme, for example "Oscuro3".
---
Well, let's save settings and restart alited.
