Along with the unit facilities, alited provides
other tools for a navigation around a project.

One of them is "Find/Replace" tool, called with:
  * Ctrl+F keys
  * "Search / Find/Replace" menu item
  * "Find/Replace" toolbar icon
---
But first of all let's remove the TODO warning.

It occurs due to the time of making this demo,
late a bit.
---
OK.

The "Find/Replace" dialogue contains two sections:
  * Find
  * Replace

Both contain 3 buttons:
  * do once
  * do in text
  * do in session
---
The dialogue provides standard options of such type.
Probably, except for one of them.

The "Replace by blank" option means that we can replace
the found strings by the blank string which means just
deleting the found strings! üó©
---
Well, let's find something:
  * once
  * in text
  * in session
---
All of the found instances in text / session
are presented in the info listbox.

The info listbox allows to enter a found line.

At that, "Find / Replace" dialogue
may or may not be closed.
---
While "Find / Replace" dialogue is open
the found strings are highlighted.

When we close the dialogue
the highlighting disappears.
---
"Find / Replace" dialogue allows to find
and replace multiple lines.

To set the lines in "Find" field, we select
them in a text and call "Find / Replace". üó©

Let's test the multiple lines' replacements.
---
üó∞ "Find / Replace" dialogue contains
a checkbox that allows (when it's ON)
to set a default geometry of the dialogue.

Sometimes we need to resize / move the dialogue,
and its geometry would be temporary being
active while the dialogue is seen. In other
cases, the default geometry will be used.
---
If, for a wonder üòÑ, we use mostly "Find" and
rather rarely "Replace", we might resize the
dialogue to its minimum sizes, thus saving
the screen's room.

The "Resize" button allows to show/hide "Replace"
options at need. üó©

Another button copies "Find" field to "Replace".
---
Other find facilities of alited are:
  * Find a unit
  * Find a declaration
  * Find a word
  * Find words by a list
  * Find in a directory
---
We press Ctrl+Shift+F or hit "Search / Find Unit"
menu item to find unit(s) by case insensitive
glob patterns.

It's VERY helpful when we remember a part of
a unit's name, so we just enter this part to find
the unit. üó©
---
To look for a proc/method declaration, we can try:

  * Ctrl+click on its name

  * press Ctrl+L, when the cursor is on its name

  * hit "Search / Look for Declaration" menu item
---
To complete a command / variable, we press Tab key
while the caret is on initial characters of a
command / proc's variable - this will show a list
of commands / variables to choose.

We enter $ and press Tab to bring only a list
of variables detected in the proc / method. üó©

The Tab key of this option may be changed to
other key(s) in "Setup / Preferences / Keys".
---
At the completion, the commands:

  * are not qualified for a current file

  * are qualified for others

Also, a completed command may be followed by
its arguments (default ones in braces).
---
Double clicking a word would highlight
all of its occurences (if red) or only one
otherwise.

üó∞ This is VERY quick method to check whether
a word is unique in a text.

Also, this is VERY quick method to view
a variable's usage in a procedure/method.
---
If we want to highlight a selection, we call
a context menu and select "Highlight All".

We can use Alt+Right / Alt+Left to find a
next / previous instance of a current word.

We use F3 to repeat this search.
---
For a quick search of a current word in all
files, there is a nice Ctrl+Shift+click
applied to the word the caret is set on.

Also, we can SELECT an arbitrary piece of text
(not just a word) and run the quick search.

It means a search throughout alited's session
and is VERY helpful in many cases. üó©
---
Sometimes, a whole list of words
should be sought in a file.

For example, we have some names
or tags and want to know where
they are mentioned and where not.

At that we might want to copy
the found and the non-found lists
for further processing.

Let's try this method.
---
To find a word or a selection in a directory
we hit the appropriate button of the toolbar.

The search will be performed by "grep"
command with options:

  * recursively in a chosen directory

  * case insensible
---
Other "grep" facilities are available in "e_menu".
---
We can search in selected files of the session.
The selection is set by Ctrl+clicking the tabs.

üó∞ The number of selected files is shown in the status bar.

The search in the selected files is available
in "Find/Replace" dialogue.
It takes place of "All in Session". üó©
