Along with the unit facilities, alited provides
other tools for a navigation around a project.

One of them is "Find/Replace" tool, called with:
    - Ctrl+F keys
    - "Search / Find/Replace" menu item
    - "Find/Replace" toolbar icon
---
The "Find/Replace" dialogue contains two sections:
    - Find
    - Replace

Both contain 3 buttons:
    - do once
    - do in text
    - do in session

The alited has the find and replace functions
united in this dialogue.
---
The dialogue provides standard options of such type.
Probably, except for one of them.

The "Replace by blank" option means that you can replace
the found strings by the blank string which means just
deleting the found strings!

As the blank replacements are rarely required,
"Replace by blank" option allows to avoid mistakes.
Use it accordingly.
---
Well, let's find something:
    - once
    - in text
    - in session
---
All of the found instances in text / session
are presented in the info listbox.
---
As you see, the info listbox allows
to enter a found instance's line.

At that, "Find / Replace" dialogue
may or may not be closed.
---
While "Find / Replace" dialogue is open
the found strings are highlighted.

When you close the dialogue
the highlighting disappears.
---
Other find facilities of alited are:
    - Find a unit
    - Find a declaration
    - Find a word
    - Find words by a list
    - Find in a directory
---
Press Ctrl+Shift+F or hit "Search / Find Unit" menu item to find
unit(s) by case insensitive glob patterns.

It's VERY helpful when you remember a part of a unit's name,
so just enter this part to find the unit.
---
To look for a proc/method declaration, you can try:

    - Ctrl+click on its name

    - press Ctrl+L, when the cursor is on its name

    - hit "Search / Look for Declaration" menu item
---
To complete a command, press Tab key while
the cursor is on initial characters of a command
- this will offer you to select from a list of
commands available in alited session's files.

The Tab key of this option may be changed to
other key(s) in "Setup / Preferences / Keys".
---
At the completion, the commands:

    - are not qualified for a current file

    - are qualified for others

Also, a completed command may be followed by
its arguments (default ones in braces).
---
Double clicking a word would highlight
all of its occurences (if red) or only one
otherwise.

This allows, for example, quick overview of
a variable's usage in a procedure/method.

If you want to highlight a selection, call
a context menu and select "Highlight All".
---
"Highlight" items of the context menu are
very helpful in many cases.

For example, we need to see which of left
braces has no its paired right brace. In
this case we select a first brace and press
Alt+Right - and next braces are highlighted.

We use F3 to repeat this search. The F3 key
goes around: after finding a last occurence
it finds a first one.
---
For a quick search of a word, there is a nice
Ctrl+Shift+click applied to the word the caret
is set on.

Also, we can SELECT an arbitrary piece of text
(not just a word) and run the quick search.

It means a search throughout alited's session
and is VERY helpful in many cases.
---
Sometimes, a whole list of words
should be sought in a file.

For example, you have some names
or tags and want to know where
they are mentioned and where not.
At that you want to be able to copy
the found and the non-found lists
for further processing.

Let's try this method.
---
To find a word or a selection in a directory
hit the appropriate button of the toolbar.

The search will be performed by "grep"
command with options:

    - recursively in a chosen directory

    - case insensible
---
Other "grep" facilities are available in "e_menu".
---
We can search in selected files.
The selection is set by Ctrl+clicking the tabs.

The number of selected files is shown in the status bar.

The search in the selected files is available
in "Find/Replace" dialogue.

It takes place of "All in Session".
