Let's set some basic options of alited,
mostly dimensions and colors.

We resize the four panes by their sizers.
---
A little bit of efforts may be made to size
"Row" column and scrollbar of the unit tree.

In particular, this needs some attention after
changing alited's Ttk theme!

At changing Ttk themes, the geometry of
widgets inside alited are affected too.
---
The alited's theme, colors and fonts are set
by means of "Setup / Preferences" menu item.
---
In General/View tab, we set a Ttk theme and
a color scheme. Also, we set a size of the
middle font (of menu, labels, buttons).
---
In Editor tab, we choose the editor's font.

We might change the colors of Tcl/Tk syntax.
Still not now. Later, in "6.Themes" demo.
---
With the new options set, let's save them
and restart alited.
