Let's set some basic options of alited,
mostly dimensions and colors.

We resize the four panes by their sizers.
---
A little bit of efforts may be made to size
"Row" column and scrollbar of the unit tree.

ðŸ—° In particular, this needs some attention
after changing alited's theme, because at that
the geometries of widgets are affected too.
---
The alited's theme, colors and fonts are set
by means of "Setup / Preferences" menu item.
---
In General/View tab, we choose a Ttk theme and
a color scheme. Also, we can set a size of
the middle font (of menu, labels, buttons).
---
In Editor tab, we can choose the editor's font.

We might change the colors of Tcl/Tk syntax.
Still not now. Later, in "6.Themes" demo. ðŸ—©
---
With the new options set, let's save them
and restart alited.
