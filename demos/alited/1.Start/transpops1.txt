Let's set some basic options of alited,\nmostly dimensions and colors.
The dimensions of alited's window\nare set usually by mouse.\n\nOr by a window manager's appropriate keys.\n\nLet's resize the four panes by the three sizers.
A little bit of efforts need to size\n"Row" column of the unit tree.\n\nNot too much, though.
The alited's colors and fonts are set\nby means of "Setup / Preferences" menu item.
Note "Help" button at the left bottom corner.\n\nAll of alited's essential dialogues are supplied with it.
With the new options set, let's restart alited.
