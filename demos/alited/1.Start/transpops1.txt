Let's set some basic options of alited,
mostly dimensions and colors.
---
The dimensions of alited's window
are usually set by mouse.

Let's resize the four panes by their sizers.
---
A little bit of efforts need to size
"Row" column of the unit tree.

Not too much, though.
---
The alited's colors and fonts are set
by means of "Setup / Preferences" menu item.
---
Notice "Help" button at the left bottom corner.

All of alited's essential dialogues are supplied with it.
---
With the new options set, let's restart alited.
