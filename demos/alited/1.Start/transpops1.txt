Let's set some basic options of alited,
mostly dimensions and colors.

We resize the four panes by their sizers.

A little bit of efforts need to size
"Row" column of the unit tree.

Not too much, though.

The alited's colors and fonts are set
by means of "Setup / Preferences" menu item.
---
With the new options set, let's restart alited.
