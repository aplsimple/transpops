Thus, alited is successfully initialized.

Let's open some files for testing alited.
---
The files are open in the current project.

The default project refers to alited's source.

The alited can't do without projects.
"3.Projects" demo is more detailed on this. ðŸ—©
---
The project files will be open in a next session
of the project.

The list of open files and their cursor positions
are saved from one session to another.

We'll restart alited just to check this.
Nothing special yet. ðŸ˜•
