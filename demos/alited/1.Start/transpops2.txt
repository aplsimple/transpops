Thus, alited is successfully initialized.

Let's open some files for testing alited.

An efficient way to open Tcl files is
"Open All Tcl Files" popup menu item
applied to a directory of the file tree.
---
The files are open in the current project.

The default project refers to alited's source.

The alited can't do without projects.
"3.Projects" demo is more detailed on this.
---
The project files will be open in a next session
of the project.

The list of open files and their cursor positions
are saved from one session to another.

We restart alited to check this. Nothing special.
