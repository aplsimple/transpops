Thus, the alited is successfully initialized.
---
Let's open some files
for alited being tested with them.

An efficient way to open Tcl files is
"Open All Tcl Files" popup menu item
run on a directory of alited's files tree.
---
The files are open in a current project.
---
The default project refers to alited's source.

It's just to start. And alited can't do without projects.

The "3.Projects" demo is more detailed on this.
---
The project files will be open
in the rest sessions of this project.

The list of open files and
their cursor positions are saved
from one alited's session to other.

Nothing special yet.
---
Let's restart alited once more just to check this.
