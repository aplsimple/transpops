Thus, the alited is successfully initialized.
Let's open some files\nfor alited being tested with them.\n\nAn efficient way to open Tcl files is\n"Open all Tcl files" popup menu item\nrun on a directory of alited's files tree.
The files are open in a current project.\n\nThe default project refers to alited's source.\n\nIt's just to start. And alited can't do without projects.\n\nThe "3.Projects" demo is more detailed on this.
The project files will be open\nin the rest sessions of this project.\n\nThe list of open files and\ntheir cursor positions are saved\nfrom one alited's session to other.\n\nNothing special yet.
Let's restart alited once more just to check this.
