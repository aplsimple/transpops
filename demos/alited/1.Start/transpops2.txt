Thus, the alited is successfully initialized.
---
Let's open some files for testing alited.

An efficient way to open Tcl files is
"Open All Tcl Files" popup menu item
applied to a directory of the file tree.
---
The files are open in a current project.

The default project refers to alited's source.

The alited can't do without projects.

The "3.Projects" demo is more detailed on this.
---
The project files will be open in next sessions
of this project.

The list of open files and their cursor positions
are saved from one alited's session to another.

Nothing special yet.

Let's restart alited once more just to check this.
