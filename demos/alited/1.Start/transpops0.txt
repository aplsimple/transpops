Welcome to "alited"!

It's a lite editor to develop Tcl/Tk applications.

At first start, it needs a simple initialization.
---
This starting dialogue means that we can have
as many configuration directories as we want.
We can pass a config directory's name to alited
as the first argument, others may be file names.

Also, this dialogue gives a useful information on
where alited stores its settings. E.g. in Windows,
we can redirect them to C:\Users\me\AppData\Local.
---
Please, notice "Help" button at the left bottom corner.

All of alited's essential dialogues are supplied with it,
some of them show the help at start like "Did you know".

And all of the tabs of dialogues provide their own helps.
---
If we are not going to have several configurations,
we use this ~/.config which is in no way harmful.

We change Tcl/Tk core directory chooser's geometry,
to make sure the geometry is active in next sessions.
It's applied to Tcl/Tk file chooser at first opening.

Now then, we confirm the offered. It doesn't hurt:)
