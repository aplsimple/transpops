Welcome to "alited"!

It's a lite editor to develop Tcl/Tk applications.

At first start, it needs a simple initialization.
---
This starting message means that we can have
as many configuration directories as we want.

Passing a configuration directory's name to alited
as the first argument, we supply it with the appropriate
preferences, such as ttk themes, color schemes, projects,
editor's preferences etc.

For example, to distinguish between our private
and public projects, work and fun etc.
---
Please, notice "Help" button at the left bottom corner.

All of alited's essential dialogues are supplied with it.

Moreover, even tabs of dialogues provide their own helps.
---
If we don't plan to have several types of
configurations, we just use this ~/.config

So, we confirm the offered. It doesn't hurt:)
