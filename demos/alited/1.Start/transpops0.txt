Welcome to "alited"!

It's a lite editor to develop Tcl/Tk applications.

At first start, it needs a simple initialization.
---
This starting message means that we can have
as many configuration directories as we want.

Passing a configuration directory's name to alited
as the first argument, we supply it with the appropriate
preferences: ttk themes, color schemes, projects etc.

Here, this is just a useful information about where
alited keeps its settings. E.g., in Windows, you can
direct them to C:\Users\me\AppData\Local.
---
Please, notice "Help" button at the left bottom corner.

All of alited's essential dialogues are supplied with it,
some of them show the help at start, like "Did you know".

All of the tabs of dialogues provide their own helps.
---
If we are not going to have several configurations,
we use this ~/.config which is in no way harmful.

Also we change Tcl/Tk core directory chooser's geometry,
to test the geometry will be active in the next sessions
and applied to Tcl/Tk file chooser as well.

Now then, we confirm the offered. It doesn't hurt:)
