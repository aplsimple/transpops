Welcome to "alited"! 🖐

It's a lite editor to develop Tcl/Tk applications.

At first start, it needs a simple initialization.
---
This starting message means that we can have
as many configuration directories as we want.
We might pass a config directory's name to alited
as the first argument, others being file names.

🗰 This dialogue gives a useful information on
where alited stores its settings. E.g. in Windows,
we can redirect them to C:\Users\me\AppData\Local.
---
Please, notice "Help" button at the left bottom corner.

All of alited's essential dialogues are supplied with it,
some show the help at start like "Did you know". 🗩

The tabs of dialogues provide their own helps.
---
If we are not going to have several configurations,
we use this ~/.config which is in no way harmful.

Now then, we confirm the offered. It doesn't hurt! 😄
