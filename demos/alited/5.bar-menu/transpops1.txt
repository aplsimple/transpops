#RUNF1: ../../../alited/src/alited.tcl DEBUG
Tools of alited are presented\nby its tool bar and menu.\n\nThus, they are called "bar/menu" actions.
Some of tools are provided by alited staticly\ni.e. they cannot be removed:\n\n    - Run\n    - e_menu\n    - tkcon\n    - Check of Tcl\n    - Color Picker\n    - Screen Loupe\n    - Tcl/Tk help (in "Help" menu)
Other tools are collected in "Tools / bar/menu" submenu.\n\nThese are provided by e_menu application.\n\nAll of them (even installed by default) can be removed\nor substituted with other tools.
In fact, "Run" and "Tcl/Tk help" are both\nprovided by e_menu application.\n\nNamely:\n    "Run" is "Run me..." item of menu.mnu\n    "Tcl/Tk help" is one of e_menu's "ornamental items"
Let's try to run some of these "standard" tools\nprovided be alited.
"Run" tries to run an application choosen\nas default for the currently edited file.\n\nFor Tcl files, it is "tclsh".\n\nBut e_menu recognizes special comments like:\n    #RUNF1: file.tcl args\nwhich mean running "tclsh file.tcl args".\n\nSo, it's possible to run a main Tcl script\nat editing any Tcl script of an application.
"Tcl/Tk help" shows Tcl/Tk man page\nfor a word the cursor is on.\n\nOr for a selected text.
Still, this context help is available only if\nTcl/Tk help pages are downloaded and copied\nto ~/DOC/www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6 directory.\n\nOr when Internet is accessible.\n\nIn such case, e_menu tries to get a help page from\n    https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6/\nwhich might be not what you want.
In alited, tkcon tool is customizable a little.\n\nTo do this, open from alited's menu\n"Setup / Preferences / Tools / tkcon".\n\n"Test" button allows to preview your settings.
Some tools, though default, can be changed or removed.\n\nThese tools are listed in "Tools / bar/menu" submenu\nand are customized in "Setup / Preferences / Tools".\n\nThis settings are also available through a popup menu\ncalled by right click on the toolbar.
In this dialogue, we can:\n    - add new actions and separators\n    - change actions or their icons\n    - remove actions and separators\n\nNew items are added by [+] button.\nOr you can use empty rows at the bottom.\n\nItems are removed by [x] button.\n\nEmpty items are ignored.\n\nThe list of items is scrollable.
To choose a tool, click its button at the right.\n\nAny non-menu items can be chosen directly\nwhile navigating through menus.\n\nIf you want to choose a whole submenu,\nright click on this submenu and choose\n"Select" from a popup menu.\n\nNote: the main menu is run by "e_menu" tool.
To change a tool's icon, click its drop-down list.\n\nThere are available icon-pictures and icon-characters.\n\nHighly likely, there is an icon expressing the tool's action.
Let's make some changes and restart alited.
