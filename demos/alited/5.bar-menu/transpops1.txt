#RUNF1: ../../../alited/src/alited.tcl DEBUG
---
Tools of alited are presented
by its tool bar and menu.

Thus, they are called "bar/menu" actions.
---
Some of tools are provided by alited staticly
i.e. they cannot be removed:

    - Run
    - e_menu
    - tkcon
    - Check of Tcl
    - Color Picker
    - Screen Loupe
    - Tcl/Tk help (in "Help" menu)
---
Other tools are collected in "Tools / bar/menu" submenu.

These are provided by e_menu application.

All of them (even installed by default) can be removed
or substituted with other tools.
---
In fact, "Run" and "Tcl/Tk help" are both
provided by e_menu application.

Namely:
    "Run" is "Run me..." item of menu.mnu
    "Tcl/Tk help" is one of e_menu's "ornamental items"
---
"Run" tries to run an application chosen
as default for the currently edited file.

For Tcl files, it is "tclsh".

But e_menu recognizes special comments like:
    #ARGS1: args
    #RUNF1: file.tcl args
which mean running "tclsh file.tcl args".

So, it's possible to run a main Tcl script
at editing any Tcl script of an application.
---
"Tcl/Tk help" shows Tcl/Tk man page
for a word the cursor is on.

Or for a selected text.
---
Still, this context help is available if
Tcl/Tk help pages are downloaded and copied
to ~/DOC/www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6 directory.

Or when Internet is accessible.
---
In alited, tkcon tool is customizable a little.

To do this, open from alited's menu
"Setup / Preferences / Tools / tkcon".

"Test" button allows to preview your settings.
---
Some tools, though default, can be changed or removed.

These tools are listed in "Tools / bar/menu" submenu
and are customized in "Setup / Preferences / Tools".

This settings are also available through a popup menu
called by right click on the toolbar.
---
In this dialogue, we can:
    - add new actions and separators
    - change actions or their icons
    - remove actions and separators
---
New items are added by [+] button.
Or we can use empty rows at the bottom.

Items are removed by [x] button.

Empty items are ignored.

The list of items is scrollable.
---
To choose a tool, click its button at the right.

Any non-menu items can be chosen directly
while navigating through menus.

If you want to choose a whole submenu,
right click on this submenu and choose
"Select" from a popup menu.

Note: the main menu is run by "e_menu" tool.
---
To change a tool's icon, click its drop-down list.

There are available icon-pictures and icon-characters.

Highly likely, you'll find an icon expressing a tool's action.
---
Let's make some changes and restart alited.
