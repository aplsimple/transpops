#RUNF1: ../../../alited/src/alited.tcl DEBUG
---
Tools of alited are presented
by its tool bar and menu.

Thus, they are called "bar/menu" actions.
---
Some of tools are provided by alited staticly,
i.e. they cannot be removed:

    - Run
    - e_menu
    - tkcon
    - Check of Tcl
    - Color Picker
    - Screen Loupe
    - Tcl/Tk help
---
Other tools are collected in "Tools / bar/menu" submenu.

These are provided by e_menu application.

All of them (even installed by default) can be removed
or substituted with other tools.
---
In fact, "Run" and "Tcl/Tk help" are both
provided by e_menu application.

Namely:
    "Run" is "Run me..." item of menu.mnu
    "Tcl/Tk help" is one of "ornamental items"
---
By default, "Run" tries to run an application
associated with a currently edited file.

For Tcl files, it is "tclsh".
---
But alited recognizes special comments like:
    #RUNF: file.tcl args
    #RUNF1: file.tcl args
    #RUNF2: file.tcl args
    ...
which mean running "tclsh file.tcl args",
and comments like:
    #EXEC: tclsh file.tcl args
    #EXEC1: wish file.tcl args
    #EXEC2: vanillawish file.tcl args
    ...

The very first of them is used to run its stuff.

So, it's possible to run a main Tcl script
at editing any Tcl script of an application.
---
"Run" executes Tcl script either of two ways:
    - running a file inside a console
    - running a file inside Tkcon

This is customized in "Preferences / Tools".
---
You might prefer to run Tcl scripts inside Tkcon.

In this case you get a profit of introspecting your
code in Tkcon.

On the other hand, the console application may be
set for Linux / Windows in "Preferences / Tools".

In Windows, powershell.exe is probably the best choice.
It can be selected from "MS Windows shell" combobox.
---
"Run" icon uses the default mode customized in
"Preferences / Tools".

But when a file is run by "Tools / Run..." menu
item or by F5 key, alited offers to run the file
either in console or in Tkcon.

It's good to have both of these modes with their
pros and contras.
---
But the most radical way to run applications
from alited is "Setup / For Run..." forced command.

When setting a command in this dialogue, we overcome
all other possibilities to run applications: all these
file associations, #RUNF:, #EXEC: are totally ignored.

The command of "Setup / For Run..." dialogue will be
run for any file currently edited.

However, calling e_menu and choosing "Run me" item
or pressing F4 key twice will run a current file
in its associated app - e_menu runs it independently.
---
"Tcl/Tk help" shows Tcl/Tk man page
for a word the cursor is on.

Or for a selected text.

Still, this context help is available if
Tcl/Tk help pages are downloaded and copied to
a directory of "Preferences/Tools/Path to man".

Or when Internet is accessible.
---
As we've seen, Tkcon tool is customizable a bit.

"Test" button allows to preview Tkcon with new
settings made.

"Default" button restores Tkcon's defaults.
---
The e_menu tool is customizable as well.
---
Some tools, though default, can be changed or removed.

These tools are listed in "Tools / bar/menu" submenu
and are customized in "Setup / Preferences / Tools".
---
In this dialogue, we can:
    - add new actions and separators
    - change actions or their icons
    - remove actions and separators
---
New items are added by [+] button.
Or we can use empty rows at the bottom.

Items are removed by [x] button.

Empty items are ignored.

The list of items is scrollable.
---
To choose a tool, click its button at the right.

Any non-menu items can be chosen directly
while navigating through menus.

If you want to choose a whole submenu, just
right click on this submenu and choose "Select"
from a popup menu.

NOTE: the main menu is run by "e_menu" tool.
---
To change a tool's icon, click its drop-down list.

There are available icon-pictures and icon-characters.

Highly likely, you'll find an icon expressing a tool's action.
---
One notice more: when calling alited's tools
(excepting Tcl/Tk help and Tkcon) all of unsaved
changes are saved according to the setting
"Preferences/Saving/Save before bar/menu runs".

It's good to set it to "All files" which means
saving all of unsaved files before running tools.
---
After changes done, we should save them.

This will restart alited.
