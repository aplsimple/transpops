The alited editor is "unit oriented".

This means making a unit tree of Tcl code
- branches and leaves.

The branches are created with special comments.

The leaves are Tcl procedures and methods.
---
To add a branch, the key combinations are used:
  - Shift+F1 for 1st level
  - Shift+F2 for 2nd level
  - Shift+F3 for 3rd level

New levels of branches can be added, and
the keys and comments are customizable too.
---
To add a procedure / method, the keys are used:
  - Alt+P to add a procedure
  - Alt+M to add a method
---
The unit tree has its own toolbar
allowing to arrange the tree.

The Up / Down buttons allow to move
unit(s) through the tree, so a code
can be rearranged without cut & paste.
---
A unit can be drag-and-dropped,
a target being before a drop point.
---
To move a group of units,
we select them with Ctrl+click.
---
If a selected unit group needs to be moved to
some far location, "Drop selected..." menu item
might be helpful.

The group units are selected without any order.
---
The visited units are highlighted
in the unit tree by a color.
---
At navigating through the unit tree,
the cursor positions are saved/restored
in visited units.

We can continue with units in the same
positions we left them.
---
There is "Last Visited" list of units as well.

Let's see how it is populated.

The following actions fill "Last Visited" list:
  - click on a unit
---
  - change a unit's content
---
  - switch tabs of edited files
---
  - choose the unit tree's item
---
  - choose the infobar's item
---
  - choose the Favorites/Last Visited's item
---
  - press Alt+Backspace ("To Last Visited")
---
  - press Alt+B ("To Matched Bracket")
---
  - press Ctrl+L ("Look for Declaration")
---
  - press F3, Alt+Q, Alt+W, Alt+Left, Alt+Right
---
  - undo / redo changes
---
Some of units may be considered as favorite. If so,
they are appointed favorites with "Favorites" toolbar.

Any current unit (leaf / branch) can be favorite.

The "Favorites" list is per a project.
---
If some favorites' list is considered valuable,
the list can be saved by its own name.
---
After pressing Ctrl+Shift+F, "Search Units" bar
is shown, allowing to search units by their case
insensitive glob patterns.

Very useful.
---
The info listbox' context menu allows
to set "Don't focus a text" mode
in order to scan the found units with keys.
---
After pressing Ctrl+G, "Go to Line" dialogue
is shown, allowing to go inside a unit by its
relative number of line.

Useful at getting a Tcl error message with
a proc / method name and a line number.
---
The alited provides a tool to check Tcl code
for consistencies of brackets.

Useful at getting an obscure error message.
---
At checking Tcl code, a whole content of a unit
has to be checked from its start to a next unit's.

Some "errors" are natural and eliminated by
"END of namespace" or similar branches.
---
By the way, did you notice the red bar icons
at the items of the unit tree?

They mean "the more red the more long".

Thus, the redness is like a message:
Beware, this unit needs to be refactored!
---
The tree of units and the tree of project files
are switched to/from by appropriate buttons.

The file tree is considered in "3. Projects" demo.
