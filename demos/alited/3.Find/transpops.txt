Along with the unit facilities, alited provides
other tools for a navigation around a project.

One of them is <r>Find / Replace</r> tool, called with:
  * <b>Ctrl+F</b> keys
  * <b>Search / Find/Replace</b> menu item
  * <b>Find/Replace</b> toolbar icon
---
The <b>Find / Replace</b> dialogue contains two sections:
  * Find
  * Replace

Both contain 3 buttons:
  * do once
  * do in text
  * do in session
---
The dialogue provides standard search options.

Probably, except for some of them.

The <r>Replace by blank</r> option means that we can
replace the found strings by the blank string
which means just <b>deleting</b> the found strings!<r> üó© </r>
---
Another <b>non-standard</b> search option is
<r>RE2</r> filter.

The <b>RE2</b> button opens a dialog to enter
RE for including / excluding the found
strings in / out the result of search.

<b>RE2</b> can greatly simplify the RE which
would be otherwise too complex if ever
possible.

Note that the <b>RE2</b> filter is applied to
<b>Exact</b> and <b>Glob</b> search results as well!
---
Well, let's find something:
  * once
  * in text
  * in session
---
All of the found instances in text / session
are presented in the <r>info listbox</r>.

The info listbox allows to enter a found line.

At that, <b>Find / Replace</b> dialogue may or
may not be closed.
---
While <b>Find / Replace</b> dialogue is open,
the found strings are highlighted with <A>blue</A>
or <B>sky blue</B>.

When the dialogue is closed, the highlighting
disappears.
---
<b>Find / Replace</b> dialogue allows to find and
replace <b>multiple lines</b>.

To set the lines in <b>Find</b> field, we select
them in a text and call <b>Find / Replace</b>.<r> üó© </r>

Let's test the <b>multiple lines</b> replacements.
---
<b>Find / Replace</b> dialogue contains <r>-geometry</r>
checkbox that allows (if ON) to set the default
geometry of the dialogue.

Sometimes we need to resize / move the dialogue,
and its geometry would be temporary, being
active while the dialogue is open. In other
cases, the <b>default geometry</b> will be used.
---
If we use mostly <b>Find</b> and rather rarely
<b>Replace</b>, we might resize the dialogue to
a minimum, thus saving the screen's room.

The <b>Resize</b> button allows to show/hide
the bottom options at need. <r>üó© </r>

Another button copies <b>Find</b> field to <b>Replace</b>.
---
Other find facilities of alited are:
  * Find a unit
  * Find a declaration
  * Find a word
  * Find words by a list
  * Find in a directory
---
We press <b>Ctrl+Shift+F</b> or hit <b>Search / Find Unit</b>
menu item to find unit(s) by case insensitive
glob patterns.

<r>üó∞ </r>It's VERY helpful when we remember a part of
a unit's name, so we just enter this part to find
the unit.
---
To look for a <r>proc/method declaration</r>, we can try:

  * pressing <b>Ctrl+L</b>, when the cursor is on its name

  * <b>Ctrl+click</b> on its name

  * hitting <b>Search / Look for Declaration</b> menu item
---
To <r>complete a command / variable</r>, we press <b>Tab</b> key
while the caret is on initial characters of a
command / proc's variable - this will show a list
of commands / variables to choose.

We enter <b>$</b> and press <b>Tab</b> to bring only a list
of variables detected in the proc / method.

The <b>Tab</b> key of this option may be changed to
other key(s) in <b>Setup / Preferences / Keys</b>.

To type Tab character, <b>Ctrl+T</b> is always at hand.
---
At the completion, the commands:

  * are not qualified for a current file

  * are qualified for others

Also, a completed command may be followed by
<b>its arguments</b> (default ones in braces).
---
<r>Double clicking a word</r> will highlight
<I>all</I> of its instances (if <H>red</H>) or
only <G>one</G> otherwise.

<r>üó∞ </r>This is VERY quick method to check
if a word (e.g. variable, proc or
method name) is <b>unique</b> in a text.

Also, this is VERY quick method to view
a <b>variable's usage</b> in a proc/method.
---
If we want to highlight a selection, we call
a context menu and select <r>Highlight All</r>.

We can use <b>Alt+Right / Alt+Left</b> to find a
next / previous instance of a current word.

We use <b>F3</b> to repeat this search.
---
For a quick search of a current word in all
files, there is a nice <b>Ctrl+Shift+L</b> or
<b>Ctrl+Shift+click</b> applied to the word
the caret is set on.

Also, we can SELECT an arbitrary piece of text
(not just a word) and run <b>this quick search.</b>

It means a search throughout alited's session
and is VERY helpful in many cases.<r> üó© </r>
---
Sometimes, a whole <r>list of words</r>
should be sought in a file.

For example, we have some <b>names</b>
or <b>tags</b> and want to know where
they are mentioned and where not.

At that we might want to copy
the found and the non-found lists
for further processing.

Let's try this method.
---
To find a word or a selection <r>in a directory</r>
we hit the appropriate button of the toolbar.

The search will be performed by <b>grep</b> command
with options:

  * case insensible

  * recursively in a chosen directory
---
Other <b>grep</b> facilities are available in <b>e_menu</b>.
---
We can search in <r>selected files</r> of the session.
The selection is set by <b>Ctrl+clicking</b> the tabs.

<r>üó∞ </r>The number of selected files is shown in the
status bar.

The search in the selected files is available
in <b>Find / Replace</b> dialogue.

It takes place of <b>All in Session</b>.<r> üó© </r>
---
For best viewing / searching colors, alited provides
<r>Edit / Color Values</r> menu item.

This allows viewing colors throughout a text or its
current page.
---
Next demo is <g>4.Tools_alited</g>,
it's about tools of alited.

Thanks for your attention. <g>üëç </g>
