OK, again about new features of <g>alited v1.7.0</g>.
______________________________________________

In <b>Saved Lists of Favorites</b>, the <r>Open...</r>
button can be very useful.

We use favorite lists to open them as a sort
of <b>subprojects</b> inside a project - very nice.

Still often we need not the favorites by
themselves, but <b>their files mostly</b>. The <r>Open...</r>
button is the best tool for this case.

Also, the <r>Open...</r> button makes the open files
be seen <b>at the beginning</b> of the tab bar.<r> 🗰 </r>

The last little thing of <g>alited v1.7.0</g>
is <b>Comment styles</b>, i.e. most usable ones:

 - <b>TODO</b> style (alited's default)

 - <b>classic</b> style (at line's beginning)

 - <b>sticky</b> style (at line's first character)

The thing is <r>really little</r>.
