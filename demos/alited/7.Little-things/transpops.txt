In this demo, we'll see some modified and new
features introduced in alited <b>v1.7</b>.

First, we'll deal with the modifications.

Then with the new stuff.
---
The <b>rectangular selection</b> had a problem with
Cut/Copy of selections containing <b>empty lines</b>.

In <g>alited v1.7.0</g> this was fixed.

Let's test it.
---
In Linux, <b>date</b> and <b>color</b> pickers were shown
under the mouse pointer.

Mostly, it was not likable because the edited
lines were often overlapped by the pickers.

In <g>alited v1.7.0</g> the pickers are open
<b>under the caret</b>, so that the line with its
possible date or color value is seen.
---
The mapping of <r>Tab key</r> in alited could embarass
the users who like to use it for the indenting
as <r>Tab key</r> tried to auto-complete no matter what.

In <g>alited v1.7.0</g> it behaves smarter:

 - if the cursor is over a word/letter,
   then <r>Tab key</r> <b>auto-completes it</b> (as earlier)

 - if the cursor is at initial spaces or first
   character of the line, <r>Tab key</r> <b>indents it</b>

 - if the cursor is over non-word inside the line
   <r>Tab key</r> <b>inserts Tab character</b>
---
In <b>Projects/Options</b>, there is <r>leaf's RE</r>
option that corresponds to the analogue
option of <b>Preferences/Unit</b>. It's used
to display units in the unit tree.
_______________________________________

If it is switched <b>ON</b>, it is active for
this project.

If it is switched <b>OFF</b>, then <r>leaf's RE</r>
option of <b>Preferences/Unit</b> is active
for this project.

If the latter is also <b>OFF</b>, then <b>proc</b>
and <b>method</b> declaration will mean <r>leaf</r>.
---
The <r>leaf's RE</r> option allows placing the
descriptions (<b>docstrings</b>) of <b>procs</b> and
<b>methods</b> above (<r>outside</r>) the unit declarations.

This type of docstrings is used by some users
who prefer also the appropriate doc generators.
_______________________________________________

The alited project by itself uses the <r>inside</r>
descriptions and <b>Ruff!</b> doc generator.
---
The new feature of alited allows moving
the docstrings <r>outside</r> and <r>inside</r> the bodies
of <b>procs</b> and <b>methods</b>.

It can also <b>normalize</b> the docstrings or
change <b>separator</b> comments separating units.

The feature is located in
<b>Setup / Move unit descriptions</b> menu item.
---
Let's move the alited's docstrings <r>outside</r> its units.

We'll try it on the <b>current</b> .tcl file.

<r>ðŸ—° </r> To enable processing other files, i.e. <b>All open</b>
mode, we should glance at them (<b>open</b>), at least once.
---
Let's play with moving the unit descriptions
<b>inside</b> and <b>outside</b> the units.

We'll <b>compare</b> the results to the original using
by the way the novelty of alited - <r>File/Clone</r>.
_______________________________________________

After that we'll return to <r>inside</r> docstrings.
---
Another new feature of alited is <r>Edit/Formats</r>
menu allowing some standard operation on the texts.

Changing <b>letter case</b> and <b>sorting</b> are most obvious.

The sorting can also result in the <b>unique</b> lines.
---
For those users who (like me) use a <r>two language
keyboard</r>, there occurs often a problem:

 - you <b>think</b> the keyboard layout is English
   (while it is not) and you type "English" text
   with non-English keyboard; or vise versa

 - result: abracadabra

To map the abracadabra into a proper text,
alited provides <b>Formats/Keyboard</b> converters.
---
Some of useful alited's <r>tear-off menus</r>
can be restored through <b>alited sessions</b>, if
they were open at closing alited.

These are all <b>Edit</b> submenus (excl. <b>Comments</b>),
<b>Tools/Paver</b> and <b>Setup/Tint</b>.

Let's arrange the following <r>tear-off menus</r>:
 - Strings
 - Keyboard
 - Rectangular selection
 - Color Values
---
Let's restart alited to confirm that
the <r>tear-off menus</r> will be active through
<b>alited sessions</b>.

Also, we'll change some settings which
can be <b>rather useful</b> to some degree.
---
It's good to set <b>Save configuration</b> options
all to <b>ON</b>.

As well as <b>Save before bar-menu runs</b> option.

When <b>Confirm exit</b> is set to <b>"> 1"</b>, it means
the timeout in seconds before closing alited.
_____________________________________________

At saving preferences, we will restart alited
and as such will see all changes to it.
