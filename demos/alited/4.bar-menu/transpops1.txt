#RUNF1: ../../../../alited/src/src/alited.tcl DEBUG
---
Tools of alited are presented
by its tool bar and menu (<r>bar-menu</r> actions).

Some of tools are provided by alited staticly,
i.e. they cannot be removed.

Other tools are collected in <r>Tools / bar-menu</r>
submenu. These are provided by <b>e_menu</b> and can
be removed or substituted for other tools.
---
By default, <r>Run</r> tool tries to run an application
associated with a currently edited file.

For Tcl files, it is an application that is set as
<b>Preferences / Tools / tclsh...</b> setting.

If this setting is empty, Tcl files are run with
the same Tcl runtime as <b>alited</b> is. <r>ðŸ—© </r>
---
<r>Run</r> executes Tcl script either of two ways:

  * running a file inside a <b>console</b>
  * running a file inside <b>Tkcon</b>

It's good to have both of these modes with their
pros and contras.

This is customized in <b>Tools / Run...</b> dialogue.<r> ðŸ—© </r>
---
We might prefer to run Tcl scripts inside <r>Tkcon</r>.

In this case we get a profit of introspecting our
code in Tkcon.

On the other hand, a <b>console</b> application may be
set for Linux / Windows in <r>Preferences / Tools</r>.

In Windows, <b>powershell.exe</b> is probably the best choice.
It can be selected from <b>MS Windows shell</b> combobox.
---
The <r>Tools / Run...</r> dialogue offers a lot of
choices, all of them can be saved for future uses.

At setting a command in this dialogue, we can enter
or select a command in the <b>text box</b>. The current
command is highlighted and fully visible.

There can be as many commands to run as wanted. Each
command is set in a separate line of the <b>text box</b>,
and all of them are saved <b>per a project</b>.<r> ðŸ—© </r>
---
The <b>By command RUNF#</b> choice is good with projects
having granular structure, i.e. when each file is
tested with its own command(s). <b>RUNF template</b> and this
<b>By command RUNF#</b> choice will be helpful at that.

Also, a project may require some initialization before
running the commands to test it. These initializing
commands can be set with the second <b>text box</b>.

The <b>Run</b> button allows testing a current choice.
The <b>Save</b> button saves the dialogue's settings.
---
Anyhow, calling <r>e_menu</r> and choosing <b>Run me</b> item
(or pressing <b>F4</b> key twice, or Ctrl+Click-Run) will run
a current file in its associated app.

The <b>e_menu</b> combines the power of shell scripts
with the power of Tcl/Tk.

The <b>e_menu</b>'s scripts are simple for those knowing
both the schell and Tcl scripting.<r> ðŸ—© </r>
---
<r>Tcl/Tk help</r> shows Tcl/Tk man page
for a word the cursor is on.

Or for a selected text.

This option is easily customized.
Details are in <b>Help / alited</b> menu
item (<b>Tcl/Tk help tool</b> section).<r> ðŸ—© </r>
---
Some tools, though default, can be changed or removed.

These tools are listed in <r>Tools / bar-menu</r> submenu
and are customized in <b>Setup / Preferences / Tools</b>.

Let's try the customization.
---
We can use empty rows at the bottom to
add new items. There are 3 empty items
for <b>alited's session</b> to add and test,
maximum 32 for all sessions.

Items are removed by <r>[x]</r> button.

The list of items is scrollable.
---
To choose a tool, we click its button at
the right.

Any <b>non-menu items</b> can be chosen
directly while navigating through menus.

If we want to choose <b>a submenu</b>,
we just right click on this submenu and
choose <b>Select</b> from the context menu.

The main menu is run by <r>e_menu</r> tool.<r> ðŸ—© </r>
---
To change a tool's icon, we click its <r>drop-down list</r>.

There are available icon-<b>pictures</b> and icon-<b>characters</b>.
---
At need, we can move tool items up/down.

An empty item sets a divider for alited's menu
and toolbar. Last empty items are ignored.<r> ðŸ—© </r>
---
Also, we'll change a geometry of

  * <b>e_menu</b> tool
  * <b>Tkcon</b> tool
---
One notice more: when calling alited's tools
(excepting <b>Tcl/Tk help</b> and <b>Tkcon</b>) all unsaved
changes are saved according to the setting
<r>Preferences/Saving/Save before bar-menu runs</r>.

It's good to set it to <b>All files</b>.<r> ðŸ—© </r>
---
After changes done, we should save the new
preferences.

This will restart alited.
