Tools of alited are presented
by its tool bar and menu ("bar-menu" actions).

Some of tools are provided by alited staticly,
i.e. they cannot be removed.

Other tools are collected in "Tools / bar-menu"
submenu. These are provided by e_menu and can
be removed or substituted for other tools.
---
By default, "Run" tool tries to run an application
associated with a currently edited file.

For Tcl files, it is "tclsh" or an application
of "Preferences / Tools / tclsh..." setting. ðŸ—©
---
"Run" executes Tcl script either of two ways:

  * running a file inside a console
  * running a file inside Tkcon

This is customized in "Tools / Run..." dialogue. ðŸ—©
---
We might prefer to run Tcl scripts inside Tkcon.

In this case we get a profit of introspecting our
code in Tkcon.

On the other hand, the console application may be
set for Linux / Windows in "Preferences / Tools".

In Windows, powershell.exe is probably the best choice.
It can be selected from "MS Windows shell" combobox.
---
When a file is run by "Tools / Run..." menu
item, alited offers to run the file either in console
or in Tkcon.

It's good to have both of these modes with their
pros and contras.

At setting a command in this dialogue, we can enter
or select a command in the text box. The current
command is highlighted and fully visible.
---
Anyhow, calling e_menu and choosing "Run me" item
(or pressing F4 key twice) will run a current file
in its associated app: e_menu runs it independently.

The e_menu combines the power of shell scripts
with the power of Tcl/Tk.

The e_menu's scripts are simple for those knowing both
the schell and Tcl scripting.
---
"Tcl/Tk help" shows Tcl/Tk man page
for a word the cursor is on.

Or for a selected text.

Details of customizing this option
are in "Help / alited" menu item
("Tcl/Tk help tool" section). ðŸ—©
---
Some tools, though default, can be changed or removed.

These tools are listed in "Tools / bar-menu" submenu
and are customized in "Setup / Preferences / Tools".
---
New items are added by [+] button.
Or we can use empty rows at the bottom.

Items are removed by [x] button.

Empty items are ignored.

The list of items is scrollable.
---
To choose a tool, click its button at the right.

Any non-menu items can be chosen directly
while navigating through menus.

If we want to choose a whole submenu, we just
right click on this submenu and choose "Select"
from a popup menu.

The main menu is run by "e_menu" tool. ðŸ—©
---
To change a tool's icon, click its drop-down list.

There are available icon-pictures and icon-characters.
---
At need, we can move tool items up/down.

And clicking the checkbutton will set a divider or
restore a previous setting. ðŸ—©
---
Also, we'll change a geometry of

  * e_menu tool
  * Tkcon tool
---
One notice more: when calling alited's tools
(excepting Tcl/Tk help and Tkcon) all of unsaved
changes are saved according to the setting
"Preferences/Saving/Save before bar-menu runs".

It's good to set it to "All files". ðŸ—©
---
After changes done, we should save the new
preferences.

This will restart alited.
