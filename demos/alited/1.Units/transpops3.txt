Let's open some files for testing alited.

The files are open in the current project.

The default project refers to alited's source.

<r>🗰</r> The alited can't do without projects.
---

The alited editor is <r>unit oriented</r>.

This means making a unit tree of Tcl code
- branches and leaves.

The <b>branches</b> are created with special comments.

The <b>leaves</b> are Tcl procedures and methods.
---
To add a <r>branch</r>, the key combinations are used:

  * <b>Shift+F1</b> for 1st level

  * <b>Shift+F2</b> for 2nd level

  * <b>Shift+F3</b> for 3rd level
---
The keys and comments are <b>customizable</b>.
For example, new levels of branches can be added.

<r>🗰</r> At first presentation, the "List of Templates"
dialogue shows its help. Some dialogues of alited
do the same. These presentations of help are
cancelled with <r>Don't show anymore</r> check button.
---
To add a procedure/method, the keys are used:

  * <b>Alt+P</b> to add a procedure

  * <b>Alt+M</b> to add a method
---
The unit tree has <r>its own toolbar</r> allowing
to arrange the tree.

The <b>Up/Down</b> buttons allow to move unit(s)
through the tree.

A unit can be <b>drag-and-dropped</b>,
a target being before a drop point.

<r>🗰</r> A code can be rearranged without Cut/Paste!
---
To move a group of units, they are freely
selected with <b>Ctrl+click</b> (one by one).

Also, <b>Shift key</b> can be used to select
a range of units, this way:

  * click a first unit of the range

  * press Shift and click a last unit
---
If a selected unit group needs to be moved to
some far location, <r>Drop selected...</r> menu item
might be helpful.

The group's units are selected without any order.

<r>🗰</r> They are dropped in the order of their sequence.
---
The visited units are highlighted in the unit tree
by a color (the same as proc/method of Tcl).

This rule doesn't relate to branches.
---
However, if a unit contains <r>TODO comments</r>,
it is highlighted with red color, no matter it's
a leaf or a branch.

TODO comments begin with <r>#!</r> so that Unix shebangs
are highlighted in the same manner as TODOs.

Alternatively, we can set TODO comments in the
<r># TODO <...></r> form.
---
<r>🗰</r> When some lines are commented out
with Edit/Comment menu item, they are marked
as TODO comments which is good:

  * to see the comments as quickly as possible

  * to search them in a session by #! pattern

  * to solve them as they are the real TODOs

<r>Edit/Uncomment</r> menu item restores the lines.
---
At navigating through the unit tree,
the cursor positions are <b>saved/restored</b>
in visited units.

<r>🗰</r> We can continue with units in the same
positions we left them.
---
"Search / To Last Visited" or Alt+Backspace
allow to switch between <b>two last visited</b> units.

There is <r>Last Visited</r> list of units as well.
Let's see how it is populated.

Nearly all actions with a text lead to updating
"Last Visited" list excepting a simple navigation
with Up / Down / PageUp / PageDown keys. <r>🗩</r>
---
Some of units may be considered as <b>favorite</b>. If so,
they are appointed favorites with "Favorites" toolbar.

Any current unit (leaf or branch) can be favorite.

The "Favorites" list is <r>per a project</r>.
---
If some favorites' list is considered valuable,
the list can be <b>saved by its own name</b>.

Then, the saved lists can be used as a sort of
<b>subprojects inside projects</b> to solve their
appropriate tasks.
---
After pressing <b>Ctrl+Shift+F</b>, "Search Units" bar
is shown, allowing to search units by their case
insensitive glob patterns.

<r>🗰</r> VERY useful.
---
The info listbox' context menu allows to
set <b>Don't focus a text</b> mode in order to
scan the found units with keys.
---
After pressing <b>Ctrl+G</b>, "Go to Line" dialogue
is shown, allowing to go inside a unit by its
relative number of line.

Useful at getting a Tcl error message with
proc/method name and a line number.
---
The alited provides a tool to <b>check Tcl code</b>
for some consistencies.

Every proc/method is checked for consistencies
of braces, brackets and quotes as well as for
duplicate unit names. Also a whole of the file
is checked for the consistencies.

At opening "Check Tcl" dialogue, <b>a current file
is checked automatically</b>.

<r>🗰</r> VERY useful at getting an obscure Tcl error.
---
Also, the checking is executed for a current proc
or method before <r>Run the file</r> automatically!

We don't test this now to avoid auto-saving files.

Details on "Run" tool are in "4. Tools" demo. <r>🗩</r>
# TRANSPOPS_red
---
At checking Tcl code, a whole content of a unit
has to be checked from its start to a next unit's.

Some "errors" are natural and eliminated by
<b>END of namespace</b> or similar branches which
are good for documentation / visibility as well.
---
By the way, did you notice the <r>red bar icons</r>
at the leaves of the unit tree?

<r>🗰</r> They mean "the more red the more long".

Thus, the redness is like a message:
Beware, this unit needs to be refactored!
---
The tree of <b>units</b> and the tree of <b>project files</b>
are switched to / from by appropriate buttons.

The file tree is detailed in "2. Projects" demo. <r>🗩</r>
