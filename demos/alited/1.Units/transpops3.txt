Let's open some files for testing alited.

The files are open in the current project.

The default project refers to alited's source.

The alited can't do without projects.
---

The alited editor is "unit oriented".

This means making a unit tree of Tcl code
- branches and leaves.

The branches are created with special comments.

The leaves are Tcl procedures and methods.
---
To add a branch, the key combinations are used:

  * Shift+F1 for 1st level

  * Shift+F2 for 2nd level

  * Shift+F3 for 3rd level
---
The keys and comments are customizable.
For example, new levels of branches can be added.

🗰 At first presentation, the "List of Templates"
dialogue shows its help. Some dialogues of alited
do the same. These presentations of help are
cancelled with "Don't show anymore" check button.
---
To add a procedure / method, the keys are used:

  * Alt+P to add a procedure

  * Alt+M to add a method
---
The unit tree has its own toolbar allowing
to arrange the tree.

The Up / Down buttons allow to move unit(s)
through the tree.

A unit can be drag-and-dropped,
a target being before a drop point.

🗰 A code can be rearranged without Cut / Paste!
---
To move a group of units, they are freely
selected with Ctrl+click (one by one).

Also, Shift key can be used to select
a range of units, this way:

  * click a first unit of the range

  * press Shift and click a last unit
---
If a selected unit group needs to be moved to
some far location, "Drop selected..." menu item
might be helpful.

The group's units are selected without any order.

🗰 They are dropped in the order of their sequence.
---
The visited units are highlighted in the unit tree
by a color (the same as proc / method of Tcl).

This rule doesn't relate to branches.
---
However, if a unit contains "TODO comments",
it is highlighted with red color, no matter it's
a leaf or a branch.

TODO comments begin with #! so that Unix shebangs
are highlighted in the same manner as TODOs.

Alternatively, we can set TODO comments with
"# TODO <...>".
---
🗰 When some lines are commented out
with Edit/Comment menu item, they are marked
as TODO comments which is good:

  * to see the comments as quickly as possible

  * to search them in a session by #! pattern

  * to solve them as they are the real TODOs

Edit/Uncomment menu item restores the lines.
---
At navigating through the unit tree,
the cursor positions are saved/restored
in visited units.

🗰 We can continue with units in the same
positions we left them.
---
"Search / To Last Visited" or Alt+Backspace
allow to switch between two last visited units.

There is "Last Visited" list of units as well.

Let's see how it is populated.

Nearly all actions with a text lead to updating
"Last Visited" list excepting a simple navigation
with Up / Down/ PageUp / PageDown keys. 🗩
---
Some of units may be considered as favorite. If so,
they are appointed favorites with "Favorites" toolbar.

Any current unit (leaf / branch) can be favorite.

The "Favorites" list is per a project.
---
If some favorites' list is considered valuable,
the list can be saved by its own name.

Then, the saved lists can be used as a sort of
"subprojects inside projects" to solve their
appropriate tasks.
---
After pressing Ctrl+Shift+F, "Search Units" bar
is shown, allowing to search units by their case
insensitive glob patterns.

🗰 VERY useful.
---
The info listbox' context menu allows to
set "Don't focus a text" mode in order to
scan the found units with keys.
---
After pressing Ctrl+G, "Go to Line" dialogue
is shown, allowing to go inside a unit by its
relative number of line.

Useful at getting a Tcl error message with
a proc / method name and a line number.
---
The alited provides a tool to check Tcl code
for some consistencies.

Every proc/method is checked for consistencies
of braces, brackets and quotes as well as for
duplicate unit names. Also a whole of the file
is checked for the consistencies.

At opening "Check Tcl" dialogue, a current file
is checked automatically.

🗰 VERY useful at getting an obscure Tcl error.
---
Also, the checking is executed for a current proc
or method before "Run the file" automatically!

We don't test this now to avoid auto-saving files.

Details on "Run" tool are in "4. Tools" demo. 🗩
# TRANSPOPS_red
---
At checking Tcl code, a whole content of a unit
has to be checked from its start to a next unit's.

Some "errors" are natural and eliminated by
"END of namespace" or similar branches which
are good for documentation / visibility as well.
---
By the way, did you notice the red bar icons
at the leaves of the unit tree?

🗰 They mean "the more red the more long".

Thus, the redness is like a message:
Beware, this unit needs to be refactored!
---
The tree of units and the tree of project files
are switched to / from by appropriate buttons.

The file tree is detailed in "2. Projects" demo. 🗩
