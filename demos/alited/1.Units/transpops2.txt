Let's set some basic options of alited,
mostly dimensions and colors.

We resize the four panes by their sizers.
---
A little bit of efforts may be made to size
"Row" column and scrollbar of the unit tree.

<r>ðŸ—° </r>In particular, this needs some attention
after <b>changing alited's theme</b>, because at that
the geometries of widgets are affected too.
---
The alited's theme, colors and fonts are set
by means of "Setup / Preferences" menu item.

In General/View tab, we choose a Ttk <b>theme</b> and
a <b>color scheme</b>. Also, we can set a size of
the middle <b>font</b> (of menu, labels, buttons).

With the new options set, let's save them
and restart alited.
