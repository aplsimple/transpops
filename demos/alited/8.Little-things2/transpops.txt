In this demo, we'll consider some <b>new features</b>
introduced in alited <b>v1.8</b>.

The main are

  - <r>Project printer</r> to create a <b>hard copy</b>
    of the project

  - <r>Pluginable</r> of Edit / Formats to create
    pluginable formatters of alited
---
The hard copy is a set of <b>.html files</b> that are
created from selected project files, supplied with
navigation links (incl. <b>unit trees</b>) and READMEs.

Let's create the <b>hard copy</b> of alited project.

For this, we run "Tools/Project Printer" menu item.
---
First, we select a directory where the result
will be saved to.

Its name may be a concatination of names
  <b>some directory</b>
  + <b>alited</b>
  + <b>project name</b>
---
Then we can choose a markdown processor
to convert <b>.md</b> to <b>.html</b> files
(as README.md will be included).

The <r>pandoc</r> tool is probably the best
for converting documents to HTML format.

There is also <r>alited</r>'s own converter.
Though very basic, it complies with most
requirements of Tcl/Tk projects' READMEs.
---
We can also enter <b>our own command</b> for
converting md -> html.

The command must include two wildcards:
  <b>%i</b> - input file name (.md)
  <b>%o</b> - output file name (.html)

E.g. <b>pandoc -o %o %i</b> is used at
calling <r>pandoc</r> converter.
---
The <r>final processor</r> is just a command to
be called after processing the selected files
of the project. The default <r>%D</r> means opening
the resulting <b>index.html</b>.

To select files, <r>file tree</r> is used, with
its <b>toolbar</b> and <b>Space</b> key.
---
Let's select files and run <b>project printer</b>.

At viewing the result, we will go to and fro
<b>index.html</b> and project files.
---
Instead of <r>%D</r> of final command, we could use
a specific processor, e.g. to embed the resulting
<b>hard copy</b> in the project description.

For example, I use the command
  <b>%E %A/lib/e_menu/e_menu.tcl m=%M/misc ex=7</b>

to embed the result in
  <link>https://aplsimple.github.io</link>
---
In <r>Edit/Formats</r>, new possibilities are:

 - <b>Mode=5</b> to insert the result of commands
   to the text at the current cursor position

 - <b>Mode=6 (Pluginable menu)</b> to make the
   formatters be called with hot keys
---
The most interesting are the <r>pluginables</r>.

The appropriate formatter files have <b>.tcl</b>
extensions as they contain the Tcl code block.

The <b>events=</b> line sets a list of events
that will run the formatter. E.g., it may be
two key combination like <b><Alt-T>, <Alt-t></b>.
---
After first running a formatter from <b>Pluginable</b>
menu, it is registered to run with hot keys.

Let's run <b>Info</b> and <b>Calendar</b>.

The calendar is of <b>tklib</b> standard Tcl library.
---
The call of calendar may be problematic, if you
had installed <b>alited</b> by its installer: then
it's run by a stand-alone tclkit having no <b>widget</b>
package with the calendar.

To solve this, use a bit modified <r>alited.sh</r>:
just define <b>TCLLIBPATH</b> environment variable
before alited's call (or use <b>~/.profile</b>).

<r>üó∞ </r> It's a universal method to solve problems
with <b>external packages</b>: install them and
correct <b>TCLLIBPATH</b> environment variable, then
run <r>alited</r> by means of <r>alited.sh</r>.
---
The <b>pluginable</b> scripts provide additional
possibilities for extending <b>alited</b>.

Others are provided with <b>e_menu</b>.
____________________________________________

But unlike <b>e_menu</b>'s items, the <b>pluginables</b>
can employ the internals of <b>alited</b>:

  - text buffers (current is <b>%W</b> wildcard)

  - alited's procs (documented in <b>Reference</b>)

In fact, they are <b>plugins</b> with very low
barrier to developing them.
---
By the way, <b>alited</b>'s calendars have
acquired the week numbers, trying to mimic
the <b>tklib</b>'s calendar.

This option is customized with Setup menu.
---
The <r>book-mark</r> bar is the most visible
of the new <b>alited</b>'s features.

The <b>book-marks</b> are especially useful
to navigate over documents without much
of structure.

Though, sometimes even a well structured
Tcl script may require book-marking.
---
To set a book-mark, we click an empty cell
of the <b>book-mark</b> bar.

To go to a book-marked position, we click
the <b>color mark</b>.

There are 24 colors to mark. In practice,
1, 2 .. 10 would be probably used.
---
To clear a book-mark, we click it with the
<b>right</b> mouse button.

After the right-clicking an <b>empty cell</b>
the popup menu will be shown to

  - clear all book-marks

  - customize the bar width
---
Another new feature is the selection to
the line ends with <b>Rectangular selection</b>.

For this, the caret is set to <r>the same</r>
final position as at start.

To select to the line beginnings, we set
the caret's final position to 1st column.
---
Another little change deals with the <b>tab bar</b>.

If we move tabs (current or several) <b>behind</b>
a tab (with the bar's popup menu), the current tab
<b>doesn't follow</b> the moved tabs. It remains as close
to the old one as possible.

This is good when we want to view only those tabs
that are important now. Thus we clear the current
page of tabs.
---
In <r>Templates</r> the changes are:

 - <b>%M</b> wildcard means a path to the <b>user's</b> menus
   not to <b>alited's</b>

 - <b>Indent</b> checkbutton gone: now, all templates
   (except for those with <r># TODEL</r> comments!)
   are indented according to the current or
   nearest line's indentation.
---
The last little thing:

<r>Ctrl+click</r> on <b>Undo</b> / <b>Redo</b> tool of the toolbar
does all undos / redos made before.
---
The <b>Undo all</b> feature can be insidious, when
important changes are lost, at that being not
committed nor stashed.

The <b>Preferences / Saving / Back up files</b> option
can be helpful at that. The <b>Maximum</b> field allows to
backup a few of file copies, named like: file-1.bak,
file-2.bak, file-3.bak... They are created at saving
files.

After setting backup options, we'll restart <b>alited</b>,
then try to lose "important changes" and find them
saved to a backup file.
