ðŸ—° Note that after changing a theme
the widgets' geometry would highly likely
change too.

Pay please attention to "Row" column and
the scrollbar of the unit tree. ðŸ—©

Though, after your initial customization,
the internal widgets' geometry would be
right in all of alited's future sessions.

The "Setup / Tint" allows you to tint
a current color scheme.

It's per a session only.

ðŸ—° When all of sudden you get a feeling that
too much of light / darkness is around,
this option might help.
---
All of submenus of alited have "tear-off"
feature which is quite convenient for
multiple choices.

For example, we may tear-off "Recent files"
to open a few of them.

Let's return to Preferences again.

For aw*, azure, forest, sun-valley, *brown themes
there are their appropriate color schemes:
  * AwLight / AwDark
  * AzureLight / AzureDark
  * ForestLight / ForestDark
  * SunValleyLight / SunValleyDark
  * LightBrown / DarkBrown

ðŸ—° Still, for any light / dark theme there is
a nice appropriate light / dark color scheme.
---
For example, nice dark theme / CS pairs are:
  * awdark / MildDark1
  * azure-dark / Quiverly
  * forest-dark / Dusk
  * sun-valley-dark / AwDark (favorite!)

Plus, "Tint" option and 4 defaults of Tcl
syntax... Uff, so much good combinations!
---
Let's try "darkbrown" theme.
It needs an appropriate color scheme.

"DarkBrown" is probably a best choice.

But we might try another scheme.
The difference will be in:
  * color of context menu
  * color of gutter
  * color of line's highlight
