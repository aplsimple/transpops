<r>ðŸ—° </r>Note that after changing a theme
the widgets' geometry would highly likely
change too.

Pay please attention to <b>Row</b> column and
the scrollbar of the unit tree. <r>ðŸ—© </r>

Though, after an initial customization,
the internal widgets' geometry will be
proper in alited's future sessions.

The <b>Setup / Tint</b> allows us to tint
a current color scheme.

It's per a session only.

<r>ðŸ—° </r>When all of sudden we get a feeling
that too much of light / darkness is around,
this option might help.
---
All of submenus of alited have <b>tear-off</b>
feature which is quite convenient for
multiple choices.

For example, we may tear-off <b>Recent files</b>
to open a few of them.

Let's return to <b>Preferences</b> again.

For <b>aw*, azure, forest, sun-valley, *brown</b> themes
there are their appropriate color schemes:
  * AwLight / AwDark
  * AzureLight / AzureDark
  * ForestLight / ForestDark
  * SunValleyLight / SunValleyDark
  * LightBrown / DarkBrown

<r>ðŸ—° </r>Still, for any light / dark theme there is
a nice appropriate light / dark <b>color scheme</b>.
---
For example, nice dark <b>theme / CS pairs</b> are:
  * awdark / MildDark1
  * azure-dark / Quiverly
  * forest-dark / Dusk
  * sun-valley-dark / AwDark (favorite!)

Plus, <b>Tint</b> option and 4 defaults of <b>Tcl
syntax</b>... Uff, so much good combinations!
---
Let's try <b>darkbrown</b> theme.
It needs an appropriate color scheme.

<b>DarkBrown</b> is probably a best choice.

But we might try another scheme.
The difference would be in:
  * color of context menu
  * color of gutter
  * color of line's highlight
