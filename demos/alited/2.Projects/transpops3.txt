The <b>Commands</b> tab allows executing some
commands in a current project's directory.

Executing commands in all projects is good,
for example, for clearance / initiating /
checking changes etc.

By the way, all tabs are supplied with <r>Help</r>

Few words about an interesting option.

<r>üó∞ </r>Its default value is set in
<b>Preferences</b> but in <b>Projects/Options</b>
it can be reset.

The <r>Unit lines per 1 red bar</r> option means that
N lines of a unit are considered normal, while
each N additional lines of a unit would add
<b>a red bar to its icon</b> at the unit tree, up to 7th bar.

When the icon becomes <r>fully red</r>, this is like sending
<b>too long unit</b> message, i.e. the unit probably needs
some reforming.
---
Let's set this option to <b>5</b> which would mean
a procedure/method of <b>40</b> or more lines will be
<r>fully red</r> marked.
---
This thing is too long, so it's <r>too red</r>.
Even not too rosy.

Next demo is <g>3.Find_alited</g>,
it's about searching and navigating.

Thanks for your attention. <g>üëç </g>
