The alited is a <r>project oriented</r> editor,
not a general purpose one.

It provides nearly all of the necessary
to develop <b>Tcl/Tk projects</b>.

The alited project has been developed
by its own version 0.2 since 24 April 2021.
---
The projects seen by alited are stored in
<b>~/.config</b> or a directory chosen at the very
first start of alited.

The directory name can be passed as <b>first argument</b>
to alited. The file name arguments can follow it.

Thus, there may be a lot of <b>project types</b>, all are
configured in their configuration directories. E.g.
for work, home, education, foreign (fork) projects.

<r>ðŸ—° </r>The configuration directory's name is displayed
in the title of <b>Preferences</b> dialogue.
---
The <r>Projects</r> tab contains options that
can be set for new projects if the appropriate
checkbox is set ON.

If the checkbox is set OFF, options for new
projects are taken <b>from a current project</b>.
---
<r>Projects</r> dialogue is available in Setup
menu and in the tool bar.

The <b>default</b> project refers to alited's
installation directory, just for a start.

Perhaps worth to glance how alited works.
Especially so, if you use <b>apave</b> package
the alited is based on. <r>ðŸ—© </r>
---
Let's create a new project.

We must fill the appropriate data fields
- most importantly a <b>project directory</b>.

After filling the new project's fields
we press <g>Add</g> button to create it.
---
Another method to create a project is
<r>Create a project by template</r> button.

This method is based on the template of
directory / file tree, in <b>Templates</b> tab.
---
There may be up to <b>16</b> templates, all their
names being collected in the combobox.

Let's <g>create a template</g>. After its use,
it is saved in the combobox's values.

To view the result, we can hit <b>Project
directory</b> button.
---
Let's open a project.

Just selecting it in the list,
then hitting <b>Select</b> button.
---
To open existing file(s) of our project
we can switch to the project <b>file tree</b>.

Then, with double-clicking a file, we open it.

The open files are <b>highlighted</b> in the file tree.

After closing a file, it is unhighlighted.
---
A newly open file is placed by default
to the <b>beginning of the tab bar</b>.
(This mode may be switched off.)

<r>ðŸ—° </r>This is true even when a selected
tab isn't visible in the tab bar.
---
The alited provides basic facilities
for arranging a project's directory:
  <b>create / delete / move files</b>

These facilities are very basic, e.g.
<b>directories aren't moved</b>.

Still, the file managers of such type
help with little things sometimes.
---
When projects are switched,
the alited saves and restores:

  * a list of open files
  * cursor positions in the files
  * a currently open file
  * a list of favorites
  * a list of favorites' lists
---
So, when we switch to another project, alited
closes all files of the old project and open
all files of the new project.

<r>ðŸ—° </r>If we want some files of the old project
to remain open, we select their tabs with
<b>Ctrl+click</b> and switch to a new project.
---
Another way to open files of a project
inside the current one is a file list
of <r>Projects / Files</r> tab.

The files to be open are selected with
simple clicking them. After that, we
open them from the list's <b>context menu</b>.

Or we open a file with a <b>double-click</b>.
---
With the <b>filter</b> entry we can view all files
open in all projects, according to the filter.

For example, "/" filter shows all of the files.
---
This <r>Projects / Files</r> tab can be
nicely used for a sort of clearance.

It's when a lot of files need to be
selectively <b>closed</b> in the project.
---
The <b>currently edited files</b> are listed in
the file list available through:

  * right-clicking the <b>tab bar</b> of files

  * choosing <b>Tools/File List</b> menu item

  * pressing <b>F9</b> key (it's customizable)
---
The file list can be sorted. For this, set
the <b>appropriate switch</b>.

And voila: <b>F9</b> key opens the sorted list.
It's good for quick accessing files open in
alited's session, esp. at <b>freezing</b> the list.
---
The tabs of the tab bar can be <b>sorted</b>
by dates, sizes or extensions of files.
---
The detailed info of files can be switched
on/off by <r>Setup / Tip File Info</r> menu item.

The file info tips are available in:

  * the tab bar

  * the file list

  * the file tree
---
The <r>Projects</r> dialogue contains <b>Notes</b>
and <b>Reminder</b> to support a development.

The <b>Notes</b> are very good for projects that
are developed unsteadily, from time to time,
allowing to keep a list of ideas to do.
---
The <b>Reminder</b> is very good for all projects,
allowing to keep deadlines of TODOs.

<r>ðŸ—° </r>If all of the sudden you got an idea
about a project, just save it as a reminder of
the project, <b>on a date</b> supposedly convenient
for implementing it.
---
If a reminder became out-dated, there will
be <r>blinkings and whistlings</r>!
# TRANSPOPS_red
---
If a TODO needs to be postponed, it can be
moved on a day / week with <b>move</b> buttons.
---
The <b>TODO days ahead</b> field makes the TODOs
latent, i.e. while nearing to the <b>X day</b> the
TODOs will be shown yellow at first , then red
(on the <b>X</b> day).

Let's restart <r>alited</r> two times to demo this.
