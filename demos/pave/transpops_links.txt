Welcome to "apave"!

It's a Tcl/Tk package for GUI development.

Its "link" facilities will be presented here.
---
The links can be assigned to:
   "lab" - ttk::label widget
   "tex" - text widget
---
Let's consider a label with the link.
---
The linked labels are located in "View/First" tab.
---
There are three labels with links:
  two simple links
  one link with a sequence of images
---
The simple links do the same: open "Misc" tab.
---
The image link opens a bird's wiki to browse.
---
We have the code of this test
right now open in "test2_pave.tcl" tab.

Thus, let's find the appropriate code.
---
The link option can be find by "-link".
---
The "-link" option of the simple link contains:
   command(s) to execute at clicking it
   an optional tip

The tip is separated by "@@" from the command(s).
---
The image link is more complex. It consists of two labels:
   a label for image(s)
   a (optional) label for a bottom description
---
The images are birds. The descriptions are their names.
---
The images and descriptions are filled by
t::labelImaged procedure that runs
in "after idle" event handler.

It deals with the following data:
   path to the image label
   path to the description label
   -files (or -data) for images
   -label for descriptions
---
See details in the apave description.
---
The "About" dialog of this test contains
the links for a text widget.
---
The links of a text widget are made
with -tags argument.

The "link*" tags refer to the linked labels in the text.
---
The "link*" tag contains a handler and a tip
divided by "@@".

The wildcards used in "link*" tag:
   %l is the label's text
   %t is the tip
just to avoid repetitions.
---
The t::textImaged procedure fills the Tcl image
in the same manner as the mentioned t::labelImaged.
