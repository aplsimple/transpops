Welcome to "apave"!

It's a Tcl/Tk package for GUI development.

The more Tcl/Tk packages the better, this is it.
---
Its main features:
 - joining the power of "grid" and "pack"
 - uniting a creation of widgets with their layout
 - minimizing a coder's efforts at handling widgets
 - setting a natural tab order of widgets
 - theming both ttk and non-ttk widgets
 - centralizing things like icons or popup menus
 - providing 'mega-attributes', incl. user-defined ones
 - providing 'mega-widgets'
---
This demo test is test2_pave.tcl

test2_pave.tcl is the crucial test of "apave".

It opens its own code at starting.
---
Let's consider e.g. 1st tab of the notebook.

We can find its code in test2_pave.tcl, here and now.
---
First, we see some comments and
the main menu of the application.
---
Then two entry fields follow.
---
Radiobuttons: Exact, Glob, RE.
---
Prompts and fields of choosers:
 - file
 - file to save
 - directory
 - font
 - color
 - date

All, except the date, may be
combobox. Here, the directory is.
---
The text field to edit/view a text file.
---
The "tk_optionCascade" widget
presented in https://wiki.tcl-lang.org
by Richard Suchenwirth.
---
The tablelist widget by Csaba Nemethi.
---
The widgets' layout is constructed
with "grid" and "pack" united.
---
The natural tab order of widgets is set
by their L/T (left/top) relations
passed to the "grid" geometry manager.

The "pack" geometry manager is mostly used inside frames.
---
At that, frames may be scrollable.

Thanks to Paul Walton for his "sframe".
---
Some other tasty things are:
 - button with timeout
---
 - tips & balloons
---
 - links & changing images
---
 - tab bar
---
 - tool bar
---
 - status bar
---
 - listbox / combobox of file content
---
 - popup menus for appropriate widgets
