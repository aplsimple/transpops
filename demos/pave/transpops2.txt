If the theme is set at starting the application
those mentioned issues are gone.
Now, we'd note the following:
 - theming the not-ttk widgets
 - theming the menus
 - theming the standard Tk choosers
The not-ttk widgets got the theming
as well as their ttk counterparts.
The apave package at creating popup menus
cares also for their theming.
-
As well as with the main menu of the application.
The Tk core choosers are themed as well.
Ironically, the color chooser of Tk core
is not ttk themed.
-
To resolve this issue, visit https://aplsimple.github.io
and download the updated color chooser.
This color chooser provides a few of tasty features.
If you want to have some widgets not themed by apave
you can use "untouchWidgets" method
to not touch the widgets at the theming.
-
Here, the labels of "Color schemes" tab
are untouched at theming.
Few notes about icons.
-
The apave package provides two sets of icons
as of September 2021: the small and the middle.
The large icons are the same as the middle.
-
Also, the icons of menus are small by default.
The alited editor uses themes made by rdbende
and presented in https://wiki.tlc-lang.org.
-
Let's glance at the forest theme (a bit modified)
in a localized version of alited.
Welcome to https://aplsimple.github.io
for further details.

Thanks for your attention.
