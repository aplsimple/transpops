Welcome to "apave"!

It's a Tcl/Tk package for GUI development.

Its theming facilities will be presented here.
---
This test is test2_pave.tcl
that provides the widgets to theme:
 - a list of themes
 - a list of color schemes
 - a spinbox of font sizes
 - a list of icon sets
 - a tab of color schemes.
---
The themes of this test are:
  - default
  - clam
  - classic
  - alt
  - awlight (if installed)
  - awdark (if installed)

For awlight and awdark themes
a color scheme must be accordingly:
light or dark.
---
The color schemes are collected in:
 - tk_optionCascade widget
 -  "Color schemes" tab
---
There are 50 color schemes of "apave".
They are indexed from -2 to 47.

The index -2 corresponds to the default ttk theme.
In fact, it means "no apave color scheme".
---
We'll try "awdark" theme and "AwDark" color scheme (CS).

The theme and the CS are made for each other.

Also, we'll set Zoom=12 which is actually a font size.
---
This message warned us that the preferable way of theming
is to set a theme / color scheme at starting the application.

This will set "normal" dimensions and backgrounds of widgets.
---
If we are theming "on fly", there would be some issues:
 - some widgets aren't well painted
 - some widgets aren't well sized
---
Now, let's try to theme "on fly" to see what happens.

To theme "on fly" let's switch "Restart" off.
---
At changing font sizes we get some widgets distorted
i.e. too big or too small.
---
Thus, let's restart test2_pave.tcl
with the new theme, colors and sizes.
