Welcome to "apave"!

It's a Tcl/Tk package for GUI development.
---
Now, there will be presented:
   - "aloupe" package
   - color chooser
   - date chooser
---
The screen loupe is called by two widgets:
   - a toolbar button
   - a color picker

Let's try the button.
---
The loupe by itself is a small moveable window.

It is moved by drag-and-drop.
---
At dropping, the loupe's view is magnified
in the displaying window.
---
We can magnify the magnified as well.
---
The loupe's size and zoom can be set
at calling "aloupe".

Or changed "on fly".
---
Other options can be set at calling "aloupe":
   - opacity of the loupe
   - background color
   - the display's geometry (+X+Y)
   - "-ontop" (sets the display above others)
---
Some options can be used at running "aloupe" from a Tcl code:
   - a command to be run by "To clipboard" button
   - a parent window's path (to destroy "aloupe" by its parent)
---
Let's call the color chooser of "apave" package.
---
It's a bit modified Tk color chooser used in Linux.

The enhancements of Tk color chooser are:
   - the panel of color buttons
   - "Move all" option
   - "Tone moves" option
   - "From clipboard" button
   - "Loupe" button
   - better dimensions
   - ability to be themed
---
The "Move all" and "Tone moves" options
can be set at calling the chooser.

They are good for smooth tuning of color hues.
---
The "Loupe" button allows to choose colors
from the magnified screen image.
---
Let's look at the date picker of "apave" package.
---
The date picker has the following features:
   - good keyboard management
   - setting 1st day of week (Mon/Sun)
   - setting the input/output date format
   - geometry options
   - "variable" option
   - ability to be localized
   - ability to be themed
---
Let's go through the calendar,
using the keyboard only.
---
To show the guys' abilities to be themed
let's change the current theme.
---
Thus, let's restart this test
with the new colors, sizes, icons...

... and with "ru" locale.
