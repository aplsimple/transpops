Welcome to "apave"!
-
It's a Tcl/Tk package for GUI development.
-
Its dialog facilities will be presented here.
The apave dialogs are available through two classes:
   apave::APaveDialog
   apave::APaveInput
-
The first one provides "simple" dialogs:
   ok, yesno, okcancel, yesnocancel,
   retrycancel, abortretrycancel and "misc".
-
These dialogs have the appropriate buttons
and return the selected button's number or 0.
This is "ok" dialog.
Its function is just a message.
-
Plus, this specific dialog has a text message.
-
At need, a user can select and copy the text.
-
Also, if the text is supposedly large,
(e.g. taken from a variable)
the dialog can be scrollable and sizeable.
We'll see a scrollable text in a while.
-
We can resize this window. Note at that
how the window's sizes will be limited.
This is "yesno" dialog.
-
It is supplied with "-ch" option
titled "Don't show this again".
-
With the checkbutton checked,
the dialog would return 11 at choosing OK
(10 + index of the button) or 0 otherwise.
-
This manner of resulting will act
in any dialog with "-ch" option.
This is "okcancel" dialog.
-
It provides a small editor
(for the first presentation of it, though).
-
Another feature of it is a scroll bar
allowing to view hidden parts of the text.
This is "yesnocancel" dialog.
-
It is supplied with "-timeout" option
that sets a timeout for the user's response.
This is "retrycancel" dialog.
-
It is also supplied with "-timeout" option.
-
The widget to display it is the label.
Besides, the label contains the Internet link.
This is "abortretrycancel" dialog.
-
It's supplied with "err" (error) icon.
This is "misc" dialog.
-
The "misc" dialogs can have
as much various buttons as you need.
-
The buttons can have non-standard
titles and various icons.
-
The button names define the icons.
This is "input" dialog. It's of apave::APaveInput class.
-
The "input" dialog can include various widgets, e.g.
here we can test these ones:
   entry
   6 choosers
   checkbutton
   radiobuttons
   spinbox
   listbox
   combobox
   option cascade
   combobox of filtered lines of file
   text
This is a login dialog.
The test will go in another cycle.
-
Each cycle will set a new color scheme.
-
Also, some dialogs' appearance will be changed.
