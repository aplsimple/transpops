Welcome to "baltip"!

It's Tcl/Tk balloon tip package.

Its features will be presented
here, with demo widgets:
  - button
  - label
  - text
  - menu
  - checkbutton
  - listbox
  - treeview
---
The "Hello" button has a tip
positioned just under it.

The text's tip is under the text as well.

This feature is well fit for widgets
positioned in a row, e.g. in a toolbar.
---
Other widgets' tips are positioned
under the mouse pointer.

This default behavior can be changed
with "-under" option.
---
Any tip can be supplied with an icon,
as the "Hello" button here.

The "Hello" button switches its tip on/off
and changes the tip font size globally.

Also, it resets the label's tip
switching it to-alert-to-message.
---
The checkbutton disables/enables all tips.

At enabling the tips, it changes its own
options: -fg, -padding, -padx, -pady.
---
The text has two tags with their own tips.
---
The main menu's items have their tips as well.

The tips are shown in the status bar
due to -command option.
---
The label has its own tip too.

When right-clicked, it calls a popup menu.
---
The popup menu has "tear-off" option. But
only the non-tearoff menu can have tips.

The menu tips are useful e.g. when the items
are displayed as short names of files, while
the tips are wanted to be their full names.
---
Here, the popup menu's items
set new tip options globally.
---
The listbox can have tips per its items
(its indices) and per a whole widget.

Here, the button "Hello" switches these modes.
---
The treeview can have tips per its items
(its ID and columns) and per a whole widget.

Here, the button "Hello" resets these modes.
---
The balloon feature is available
due to "-geometry" option.

This option means that a tip is unrelated to
a widget and as such is a balloon message.

The balloon message is faded after a while
... or destroyed with hovering over it.
